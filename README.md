Coded in: HTML, CSS

A simple tribute webpage to the Henry Ford

Being a Ford fangirl, I created this codepen (https://codepen.io/irenecode561/pen/KKdKymY) as a tribute page dedicated to the great Henry Ford. I have since put it into a GitHub repository and hosted it. Coded only in HTML and CSS, this website features a timeline of events Ford was involved in to change the auto industry for the better.
